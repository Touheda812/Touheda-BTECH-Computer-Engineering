CET 3510 - Microcomputer Systems Technology
--------------------------------------------
An introduction to microcomputer architecture and the basic concepts used in the Personal Computer (PC). Key features of the PC are explored by writing programs 
in a high-level language (such as C) to access them. Assembly language programs are utilized to gain insight into machinelevel operations. Laboratory exercises 
support the lecture and are carried out in the context of currently available operating systems.

CST3529 – Applied Methods in Machine Learning
--------------------------------------------------
This course will teach students how to develop machine learning applications for knowledge-based systems, agent systems, 
and business strategies. The students will learn basic techniques for building intelligent computer systems and will 
understand how this branch of Artificial Intelligence learns from data to solve simple to complex real world problems. 
They will implement machine learning using neural networks, decision processes, graphic models, and regressions. Students 
are required to have some basic knowledge of Python programming and algorithms.
