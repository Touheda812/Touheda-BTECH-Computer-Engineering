CET 4705 - Component and Subsystem Design I
--------------------------------------------
Develops the foundations for performing electrical design in computer engineering technology applications. Typical systems are analyzed mathematically and graphically. Subsystems
are designed to meet specific performance criteria.

CET 4711 - Computer-Controlled Systems Design
----------------------------------------------
Modern design principles and methodologies. Software tools for systems design including computeraided design and computer-aided engineering. Students carry out the conceptual 
design of a complete device or system by integrating hardware and software sub-systems; and learn to use project management tools to manage the design process.

CET 4773 - Inter-networking Technology
Writing Intensive
---------------------------------------
Technologies, protocols, and techniques used to connect a computer network with other networks through the use of gateways that provide a common method of routing information 
packets among the networks. Internet technologies for the connection of computing devices with other internal and external devices or systems. Topics include Local Area Networks
(LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN) implementation, wireless networks implementation, network security, advanced switching and routing configuration, advanced TCP/IP configuration,
and network management.

CET 4811 - Capstone Design Project
-----------------------------------
A capstone course dealing with design and programming concepts of particular importance for computer-controlled systems. In the lab, students may choose to utilize their
concept designs from CET 4711, or to design a new device from scratch. Students apply their knowledge of component design, systems design, control theory and computer
programming to carry out detailed design of their device or system, build a working model and program a computer to perform the desired measurement and/or control functions.

CET 4864 - Principles of Feedback Control Systems
---------------------------------------------------
Introduction to feedback concepts (positive and negative). Transient and steady-state analysis using Laplace transforms. Bode plots, stability analysis, and controller design. 
Lab work includes the use of mathematical analysis and simulation.

CST3504 â€“ Database Design
---------------------------
This course is dedicated to an overview of the database design process. The three main phases in database design, namely: conceptual, using Entity Relational Diagram (ERD) and 
Unified Modeling Language (UML); logical, using the relational model, and physical, using the Oracle Database Management System (DBMS), are covered. The basics of the relational 
data model (concepts of relation, attribute, primary key, and foreign key) are reviewed, and the mapping of the conceptual model to the relational model is discussed. Advanced
concepts of relational theory (normalization, denormalization) are included. The Physical model of the database is built in Oracle. Students must be familiar with SQL.
