EMT 1111 - Logic and Problem-Solving
-------------------------------------
This course introduces the foundations of problem-solving and computer programming as it is applied to electromechanical engineering technology. 
It provides a basic understanding of number systems and programming techniques with practical examples implemented in a modern programming language. 
Concepts are developed through hands-on laboratory exercises.

Programming Language: Python

MAT 1375 - Precalculus
Pathways: Math and Quantitative Reasoning, Scientific World
------------------------------------------------------------

Topics include an in-depth study of functions such as polynomial functions, inverse functions, radical functions, rational functions, trigonometric functions, 
exponential and logarithmic functions; solving inequalities; elements of vectors and complex numbers; solving trigonometric equations and identities involving sum, 
double and half-angle formulas; Binomial Theorem; and progressions. A graphing calculator is required.

EMT 1220 - Mechanisms
----------------------

Levers, gears, cams, belts, chains and sprockets, intermittent motions, brakes and clutches. The application of these mechanisms as motion converters and electromechanical 
energy conversion systems and their displacement, velocity and acceleration. Laboratory study of physical and operational characteristics of mechanical and electromechanical
components through the technique of breadboarding. Standard industrial components are used for this purpose.
